Hello, my name is Javier Oviedo and I'm an artist from Argentina, I make illustrations and I write and draw my own comics.

I just published "(Again) CRISIS", a book you can read in this site.

I'm currently developing ideas for a new book and I'm also available for work, so feel free to contact me.
