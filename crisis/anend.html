    <h2>An end</h2>
    <p>
I just finished reading this comic book for the first time in a long time and there are things i don't even understand, however, I decided to publish it without making any modifications. I wrote and drew the first four chapters of this story in 2014, the remaining two in 2015, after that I quit art for a while and this comic remained in a drawer.
<br></br>
There are a few parts that seem to be porly drawn or written, others are confusing, and others simply are missing some details, but I cannot change them. I cannot change them, it would be injustified, mentally I cannot put myself where I was back then, I don't know what I wanted to say at the time, maybe some of the drawings I don't understand have a hidden meaning that today I can't see. And to be honest, there's nothing to add, I don't have anything new to say about this, this book is done, I'm just bothered by some drawings or phrases that today I could do better. Any change would be false because I can't feel or think the things I did when I was doing this book back then.
<br></br>
I could have published this story two years ago and I didn't. If I could explain why it wouldn't have taken me so long, I don't know the lines that define my personalinty and behavior, the only thing I can say is that phase is over.
<br></br>
The days were repeated constantly or it was a really long day, I looked at the wall and for a while I even forgot that the door existed
and though I was taught that the earth moved, I used to wake up every day in the same spot, there were moments that seemed dreams, my memories are confusing, they mix. One day I woke up, I got out of bed and I went to the bathroom.
